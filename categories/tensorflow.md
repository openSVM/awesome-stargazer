## [victor369basu/Real-time-stock-market-prediction](https://github.com/victor369basu/Real-time-stock-market-prediction)

In this repository, I have developed the entire server-side principal architecture for real-time stock market prediction with Machine Learning. I have used Tensorflow.js for constructing ml model architecture, and Kafka for real-time data streaming and pipelining.
