ansible/ansible: Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain.

khilnani/devops: Setup & installers for databases, runtimes, queues etc. using Anaconda, Ansible, Vagrant, Docker, AWS, Puppet, automation etc. - https://github.com/khilnani/devops
puppetlabs/bolt: Bolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it takes to maintain your infrastructure on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow. It can be installed on your local workstation and connects directly to remote nodes with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software. - https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt
