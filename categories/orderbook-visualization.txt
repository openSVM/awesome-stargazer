# ORDERBOOK VISUALIZATION (3 repositories)

Elenchev/order-book-heatmap: OrderBook Heatmap visualizes the limit order book, compares resting limit orders and shows a time & sales log with live market data streamed directly from the Binance WS API. This was a short exploratory project. Keep in mind that a lot of work is needed for this to work in all market conditions. - https://github.com/Elenchev/order-book-heatmap
