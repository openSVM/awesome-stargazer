# ORDERBOOK VISUALIZATION

**3 repositories**

---

## [Elenchev/order-book-heatmap](https://github.com/Elenchev/order-book-heatmap)

OrderBook Heatmap visualizes the limit order book, compares resting limit orders and shows a time & sales log with live market data streamed directly from the Binance WS API. This was a short exploratory project. Keep in mind that a lot of work is needed for this to work in all market conditions.
