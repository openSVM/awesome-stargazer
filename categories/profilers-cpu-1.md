## [Liu-xiandong/How_to_optimize_in_GPU](https://github.com/Liu-xiandong/How_to_optimize_in_GPU)

This is a series of GPU optimization topics. Here we will introduce  how to optimize the CUDA kernel in detail.  I will introduce several basic kernel optimizations, including: elementwise, reduce, sgemv, sgemm, etc. The performance of these kernels is basically at or near the theoretical limit.
