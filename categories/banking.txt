# BANKING (10 repositories)

Yassine-Ag/AMLSim: The AMLSim project is intended to provide a multi-agent based simulator that generates synthetic banking transaction data together with a set of known money laundering patterns - mainly for the purpose of testing machine learning models and graph algorithms.  We welcome you to enhance this effort since the data set related to money laundering is critical to advance detection capabilities of money laundering activities.  - https://github.com/Yassine-Ag/AMLSim
