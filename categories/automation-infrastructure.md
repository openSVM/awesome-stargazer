## [puppetlabs/bolt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt)

Bolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it takes to maintain your infrastructure on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow. It can be installed on your local workstation and connects directly to remote nodes with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software.
