## [hex-five/multizone-sdk-arm](https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-sdk-arm)

MultiZone® Security TEE for Arm® Cortex®-M is the quick and safe way to add security and separation to any Cortex-M based device. MultiZone® software can retrofit existing designs. If you don’t have TrustZone®, or if you require finer granularity than one secure world, you can take advantage of high security separation without the need for hardware and software redesign, eliminating the complexity associated with managing a hybrid hardware/software security scheme.
