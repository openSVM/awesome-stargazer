## [aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-building-a-high-performance-numerical-weather-prediction-system-on-aws](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-building-a-high-performance-numerical-weather-prediction-system-on-aws)

HPC on AWS removes the long wait times and lost productivity often associated with on-premises HPC clusters. Flexible HPC cluster configurations and virtually unlimited scalability allows you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your workloads dictate, not the other way around

## [2b-t/LB-t](https://github.com/2b-t/LB-t)

Multi-threaded object-oriented computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code for three-dimensional incompressible fluid flow on a regular grid with the incompressible lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) for general lattices (D2Q9, D3Q15, D3Q19, D3Q27, ...) with A-A pattern for indexing - programmed in C++17, multi-threaded with OpenMP
